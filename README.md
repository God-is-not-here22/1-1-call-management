# 1-1-call-management
Hey there! This repository gives you all the tools to run 1-1s sucessfully.
To start, install the sqlite3 library pasting and running "pip install sqlite3" in your VS code console.
Then download all the files.
Then run "Create names table.py" and "Create pairing table.py". Please don't change the names of the tables, because then further editing would be nessecary. Just run the two as they are. The first script creates a table called usernames which stores the names of the people signed up, and the second script records pairings to avoid repition. 
Then add the usernames of the people signed up to "Add names.py" (I have left a comment, which is "#here", at all editable places).
Once you have added all the names, go to "Pairing generator.py".
